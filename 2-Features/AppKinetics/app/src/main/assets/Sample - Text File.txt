Secure Inter-Application Communication
======================================
Feature Overview
----------------
BlackBerry Dynamics has an inter-application communication feature for secure
exchange of data and commands between two applications on the same device. The
feature is based on a proprietary and trade marked technology, AppKinetics.

Feature Description
-------------------
AppKinetics provides a data exchange mechanism that is similar to web services:

1.  The "consumer" application sends a service request to a method in the
    "provider" application. The request can include a number of parameters, and
    a number of attachments.

2.  The provider application receives the request, and possibly executes some
    processing.

3.  The provider application can then do one of the following:

    -   Send an empty service response back to the consumer.
    -   Send a service response with a number of attachments, and a number of
        parameters.
    -   Send an error response.
    -   Send no response.
